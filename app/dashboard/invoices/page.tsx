// This is how you can create different pages in Next.js: 
// create a new route segment using a folder, and add a page file inside it.
// The page file is a React component that exports a default function.
// This function returns the JSX that will be rendered as the page content.
// Can view this page at http://localhost:3000/dashboard/invoices

export default function Page() {
    return <p>Invoices Page</p>;
